If you are currently working on any problems in [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net), stop and read this!

This contains my solutions for the first 100 problems (as I complete them), so if you are working on your own solutions, don't spoil your own enjoyment by looking at these solutions. 

By the [rules](https://projecteuler.net/about) of Project Euler, the first 100 problems are loosely considered fair game for discussion and sharing of solutions, so I hope the project's maintainers will not take offense at this. 

This repository is mainly intended to show my programming skills, or as a last resort for people who are hopelessly stuck one of the first 100 problems, should they stumble upon it.
